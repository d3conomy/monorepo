## Conclusion

Achieving 99.999% reliability requires systematic improvements across all layers of the system. By following this phased approach and focusing on the critical areas identified in our comprehensive testing, we can build a production-ready system that meets the highest reliability standards.

The key is to fix the fundamental issues first (JobDirector, API health checks) and then layer on additional reliability features. With proper implementation of this plan, the Moonbase v0 API and artifacts-ts system will be ready for production deployment with enterprise-grade reliability.
