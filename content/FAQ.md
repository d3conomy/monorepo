### Isn't the cloud good enough already?

The cloud is a powerful tool, but it is not without its limitations. Centralized cloud providers can be expensive, slow, and unreliable. They can also be a single point of failure, and they can be a target for hackers and other malicious actors.

Blockchain technology is a powerful tool, but it is not the only tool in the decentralized cloud toolbox. ```d3``` is building a decentralized cloud platform that is blockchain agnostic, meaning that it can work with any blockchain or distributed ledger technology. This allows us to take advantage of the benefits of blockchain technology without being tied to any one blockchain.

### How can my data go above the cloud?

There is a beleif that data should be owned and controlled by the people who create it. We are building a decentralized cloud platform that allows users to own, control, and monetize their data. This means that users can store their data securely and privately, and they can choose who has access to it and under what conditions.

### What is the future of the cloud?

The future of the cloud is decentralized. Centralized cloud providers are facing increasing pressure from regulators, customers, and competitors. Decentralized cloud providers like ```d3``` offer a more secure, reliable, and cost-effective alternative. We are building a decentralized cloud platform that is open, flexible, and easy to use, and we believe that this is the future of the cloud.
